# Image Merger
Image Merger is a Python application that allows you to merge multiple images into one. It’s perfect for creating collages, photo grids, or combining images in creative ways.

## Features
- Merge Multiple Images: Combine any number of images into a single output image.
- Flexible Grid Layout: The application automatically arranges the images into a grid layout that’s as square as possible.
- Image Resizing: All images are resized to match the size of the first image, ensuring a uniform grid.
- Transparent Background: The merged image is created with a transparent background, allowing it to be used on various surfaces.
- Error Handling: The application includes robust error handling, including checks for invalid image paths and issues when saving the output image.

## Usage
You can use Image Merger from the command line by providing the paths to the images as arguments:

```
python main.py image1.png image2.png image3.png image4.png
```

This will create a new image named merged.png in the current directory, which is a grid of the input images.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Pillow library
